Here, I would like to showcase a selection of data science tools, repositories and other useful resources, including my own. I am interested in collaborating on connecting science questions, so please feel free to get in touch.

## TIE-GCM orbit interpolator
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/619801858.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/619801858)
[tiegcm_orbit_interpolator](https://github.com/TimKod/tiegcm_orbit_interpolator) is a simple Python code to interpolate [TIE-GCM](https://www.hao.ucar.edu/modeling/tgcm/tie.php) netcdf model outputs to given time, lat, lon, altitude.

## TIE-GCM v3.0
The NCAR TIEGCM model now has its own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/NCAR/tiegcm).
See documentation: [https://tiegcm-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://tiegcm-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## DART
The [Data Assimilation Research Testbed](https://github.com/TimKod/DART). DART is an open-source, freely available community facility for ensemble data assimilation.

## Data science tools and resources
This repository [data_science_tools_and_resources](https://github.com/TimKod/data_science_tools_and_resources) holds tools and resources related to data science.

## Space-Python notebook
Karl Laundal's [spacepython_notebook](https://github.com/TimKod/spacepython_notebook). The notebook provides an overview of some Python tools that are useful for space physics.
