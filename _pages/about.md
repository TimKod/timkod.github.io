I am a space physicist specialising in statistical data assimilation. I am motivated by the challenge of understanding and predicting the intricate dynamics of the Earth's upper atmosphere in response to space weather. For my PhD, I focused on physics-based modelling and forecasting of the [thermosphere-ionosphere system](https://doi.org/10.25439/rmt.27588945) in order to improve space weather predictions. I combine fundamental physics with advanced computational modelling and machine learning, as well as supercomputing, to transform complex datasets into actionable insights for real-world challenges. I am committed to open science and creating robust, FAIR-compliant data products and software tools that empower the global scientific community to explore these critical geophysical systems.

Research Interests
------
I'm passionate about data science. My research focuses on developing data-intensive systems for understanding and forecasting complex physical environments. I develop scalable machine learning models and data assimilation techniques to extract insights from large, multi-source geoscientific datasets. My work encompasses the entire data lifecycle, from designing high-performance ETL pipelines for terabyte-scale simulations, to applying physics-informed AI and Bayesian methods for predictive modelling. I am particularly interested in creating new data products, as well as open-source tools that can translate computational advances into actionable intelligence to address scientific and societal challenges.

My work focuses on:

- ![Bayesian optimisation](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bayesian%20optimisation-blue), ![Kalman filter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kalman%20filter-blue), ![4D Variational](https://img.shields.io/badge/4D%20Variational-blue) data assimilation for ionosphere-thermosphere;
- ![Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dynamic%20mode%20decomposition%20(DMD)-%237fcbcf);
- Developing high-resolution climate simulations, such as [OTHITACS](https://doi.org/10.26050/WDCC/OTHITACS_tiegcm);
- Remote sensing and modelling of Earth and space environments;
- Leveraging AI/ML and GPU computing to improve the accuracy of space weather modelling and forecasting.

As an [NFDI4Earth Academy Fellow](https://www.nfdi4earth.de/2participate/academy), I actively promote open science and robust research data management. I'm experienced in interdisciplinary research and have collaborated with a wide range of specialists, including space physicists, atmospheric scientists, aerospace engineers, applied mathematicians and statisticians.
