I am a space physicist and a specialist in statistical data assimilation. My research focuses on physics-based modelling and forecasting of the [thermosphere-ionosphere system](https://doi.org/10.25439/rmt.27588945) to improve space weather predictions. I combine fundamental physics with advanced computational tools, such as Python, Fortran, machine learning and supercomputing, to transform complex datasets into actionable insights for real-world challenges.

Research Interests
======
I'm passionate about data science. The upper atmosphere is a fascinating topic, not only for the management of space assets, but also due to its far-reaching consequences relating to space weather. There is also the simple curiosity of exploring a region of space that is not fully understood. My work focuses on:

- ![Bayesian optimisation](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bayesian%20optimisation-blue), ![Kalman filter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kalman%20filter-blue), ![4D Variational](https://img.shields.io/badge/4D%20Variational-blue) data assimilation for ionosphere-thermosphere;
- ![Dynamic mode decomposition](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dynamic%20mode%20decomposition-%237fcbcf);
- Developing high-resolution climate simulations, such as [OTHITACS](https://doi.org/10.26050/WDCC/OTHITACS_tiegcm);
- Remote sensing and modelling of Earth and space environments;
- Leveraging AI/ML and GPU computing to improve the accuracy of space weather modelling and forecasting.
As an [NFDI4Earth Academy Fellow](https://www.nfdi4earth.de/2participate/academy), I actively promote open science and robust research data management. I'm experienced in interdisciplinary research and have collaborated with a wide range of specialists, including space physicists, atmospheric scientists, aerospace engineers, applied mathematicians and statisticians.
